					<h3 style="color: #ee7600"><strong>History</strong></h3>
						<p>The Kent Food Bank began operations in 1970 as a temporary agency to serve
						Kent families during an economic recession.
						It has since grown into a permanent agency, providing for basic needs, food,
						clothing and shelter to thousands of families yearly.
						The Kent Food Bank is one of the founding agencies in developing South County Area
						Human Service Alliance (SCAHSA) whose mission is to streamline access to
						human services for low-income individuals and families in South King County
						by locating multiple providers in a single site known as the Alliance Center,
						thereby leveraging resources and increasing efficiency.
						In the fall of 2004, the Kent Food Bank moved into the Alliance Center.
						In addition to this facility we operate the Birch Creek Food Bank on the east hill of Kent.
						This supports our efforts to ensure that low-income families/individuals
						that need assistance will have ease of access to our services.
						One of our major goals is to alleviate hunger in our service area,
						making for a healthy and strong community.</p>

					<h3 style="color: #ee7600"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
						<p>The Kent Food Bank and Emergency Services is a non-profit organization offering food,
						clothing and emergency financial assistance to low income families and individuals living
						within the Kent School District.  The Kent Food Bank service area covers 73 square miles with
						40 schools. Kent Food Bank operates two food distribution locations in Kent each week.</p>
